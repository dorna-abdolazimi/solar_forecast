# Visualizing Seattle Socioeconomic Disparity

This is an interactive set of visualizations that illustrate the segregation and inequality present in Seattle's various neighborhoods in 2017, focusing on socio-economic factors and racial disparities. The visualizations include chloropleth maps, scatter plots, box plots, pie charts, and a radar plot. The primary datasets for this visualization are census data obtained from https://www.census.gov/ and Washington State School Report Cards obtained from https://data.wa.gov/.
