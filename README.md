# Solar Forecast

Using data gathered at a plant in India over a 34 day period, our goal is to forecast the amount of DC power generated by the plant in a day from 9 am to 8 pm with a 1 hour resolution, based on previous observations. We will use ARIMA, multilayer perceptron, and LSTM, and compare their performances.
Please find more detailed information in the notebook.
